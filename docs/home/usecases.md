# Use Cases

JanusVR provides a framework and collaborative tools for your ideas to rapidly come to life. Take a look at some of the use-cases put together for what you can create using Janus to be inspired with your projects.

To Do

### Event Planning

Location scouting and event planning the next big or small event can be greatly improved with 3D scans. Prototypes produced with Janus inside a 1:1 digital twin of a space can also then be adapted to work for Mixed Reality.

Other platforms require users to download a large native client which usually only works on powerful desktops, lack easy edit tools to build with, and have long iteration cycles to compile and share which makes collaboration difficult.

Janus excels at reducing content creation time and effort; the visual code editing style with drag n' drop is part of a UX that produces extremely fast iteration cycles.

### Hologram Presentations

There are cheap and highly effective techniques for simulcasting presentations into the virtual world. The presenter needs to just be in front of a plain background such as green screen or a special depthsense camera for this technique to be effective. The playback contains audio and video.

This technique can also be applied to stream virtual content from one platform to another. In this screenshot you are seeing a VR talk show hosted in VRChat being played back in Janus.

JanusWeb has the ability to play depthkit video using a shader. This innovation reduces the reliance on green screen setups in physical spaces to stream/archive content into digital spaces.

### Education

VR provides a distraction-free environment for learning. This example is taken from IPFS sponsored event 'Developer Meetings' in which the livestream archived footage was segmented into the 3D scene.

Instead of watching the archived video on youtube, the talks can be replayed into a virtual environment (such as the digital twin of a co-working space) with learning tools attached.

In this GIF you are looking at a live desktop preview with notes from [Proto School](https://proto.school/#/) which contains interactive tutorials on decentralized web protocols. Next to that is a collaborative text editor for jotting notes and a collaborative whiteboard. 

![](../_media/dSDQtQr.gif)

This technique can be applied to classrooms and events of any size. Talks can be simulcasted into virtual environments to accomodate users when tickets sell out to the physical event.

### Enterprise

Real Estate businesses can use JanusVR to not only visualize property but also give live tours with our multiplayer functionality. Janus offers the ability to walk people through the property in real-time from the browser without requiring third party software, whether 2D on tablets and laptops or a VR headset.

Another enterprise use-case being explored is the design and functionality of control centers. These high tech workplaces are some of the most mission critical rooms of facilities.

![](../_media/RAgbf18.jpg)

One can take the [industrial designs tools](https://new.abb.com/control-rooms/control-room-design/tools) provided by [ABB](https://new.abb.com/control-rooms) to save time and reduce costs for planning control rooms. Janus can take this a step further to simulate virtual desktops in collaborative 3D environments.

A spatial computing platform could become a major accelerator for remote work and create a stronger feedback loop within distributed teams.

Another enterprise use-case for Janus is a generalized system for 3D network visualizations. The example below is a web crawl of Janus sites and their interconnected relations.

Live network visualizations can help sysadmins and security analysts spot issues much faster than reading traditional text logs. Check out the video example below for an idea of how that looks:

### Entertainment

JanusVR can be used to create quality content for entertainment purposes fast and inexpensively. The example below features a collaboration with the owners of DNA Lounge, a nightclub in San Francisco, to create unique dual physical/virtual experiences themed on the movies Hackers and The Matrix.

### Rides

Virtual rides can be a comfortable experience for majority of headsets on the market and provide an excellent storytelling template. 

![](../_media/7h4Ofre.jpg)

The Vegas Strip Experience was originally initiatalized by a component running on Bitcoin testnet but now starts by pressing a green button. 

![](../_media/wjXKL5A.gif)

Code for this example is [open source](https://github.com/janusvr-examples/wild-ride) took a couple devs a week to build but with more effort it could turn into something worthwhile. Artists can fill in the buildings and make everything look amazing as well as having some scripted animations in place of sprites.

This type of format (like carnival rides) has legs for WebVR and monetization.

### Projection Mapping

Some experiments have been done to prototype large scale [projection mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping). This use-case can be experienced in VR but with 3D scanning and localization it can be adapted into real world shows as well.
